NTSC-PAL Color Conversion: Single-Chip Color/Mod
There is a way that to provide both color correction and mod chip functions using a 12C508 and 3.58MHz or 4.43MHz crystal and support components. However, this involves bending a couple digital design rules-of-thumb. For one, running a 12C508 that has a spec'd max clock of 4MHz at 4.43MHz should work fine, but as it is outside the spec it cannot be guaranteed. Further, the clock output pin of the 12C508 would have to also drive the CXA1645 through a 2k2 resistor. Running a wire that is part of a parallel-resonant circuit like that of a PIC crystal oscillator even a few inches to the CXA1645 might alter the loading characteristics and cause the 4.43MHz frequency to actually be some other value. I have not observed any adverse effects in the two test modules I've made thus far; perhaps the (relatively) high impedance the 2k2 series resistor is enough to attenuate the loading effects.
